### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java
<?php

namespace AshBaker;

const thai = {
  pronouns: "she" | "her",
  code: [Javascript, Typescript, HTML, CSS, Ruby, Python, Java],
  tools: [React, Redux, Node, Storybook, Styled-Components, Jest, Docker],
  architecture: ["microservices", "event-driven", "design system pattern"],
  techCommunities: {
                        coorganizer: "AfroPython",
                        speaker: "Latinity",
                        mentor: "EducaTRANSforma"
                      },
 challenge: "I am doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge focused on react and typescript"
}
